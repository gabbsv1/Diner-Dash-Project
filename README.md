In my 8-bit Diner Dash game developed in C++, players immerse themselves in the fast-paced world of diner management, cooking food and serving customers against the clock. With pixel art graphics and retro-inspired sound effects, the game captures the nostalgic charm of classic arcade games. Intuitive controls, dynamic AI, and a rewarding progression system ensure an engaging and enjoyable experience for players as they strive to meet their goals and build their virtual diner empire.
